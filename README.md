# about me!

I'm Elena, and I'm currently a computer science student at Barnard College. I have most experience using Java and Python for programming, and I have project experience using Python for AI/ML. 

I currently have no public projects, though if you would like to see my final project from the summer portion of Break Through Tech (in which I completed coursework in machine learning), please ask for access to the repository. If you are interested in the work I completed for courses, please ask me via the email I provided on my resume. There is no public access to these files to avoid publishing my solutions.



I have taken the following courses related to computer science:

- COMS W1004: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Java
  
- COMS W3134: Data Structures in Java
  
- COMS W3157: Advanced Programming (systems programming, including: C, command line interface, Git, TCP, HTTP, Socket API)

- MATH UN1101: Calculus I
  
- MATH UN1201: Calculus III
  
In Spring 2024, I will be taking:

- COMS W4111: Introduction to Databases

- CSEE W3827: Fundamentals of Computer Science

- COMS W3203: Discrete Mathematics
