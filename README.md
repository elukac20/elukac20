# about me!

I'm Elena, and I'm currently a computer science student at Barnard College of Columbia University. I have most experience using Java and Python for programming, and I have project experience using Python for AI/ML. I also have experience with data manipulation and querying using SQL and R.

If you would like to see my final project from the summer portion of Break Through Tech (in which I completed coursework in machine learning), please ask for access to the repository. If you are interested in the work I completed for courses, please ask me via the email I provided on my resume. There is no public access to these files to avoid publishing my solutions.



I have completed the following courses related to computer science and data science:

- COMS W1004: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Java
- COMS W3134: Data Structures in Java
- COMS W3157: Advanced Programming (systems programming, including: C, command line interface, Git, TCP, HTTP, Socket API)

- MATH UN1201: Calculus III
- MATH UN2010: Linear Algebra
- COMS W3203: Discrete Mathematics
- COMS W4111: Introduction to Databases (including SQL, NoSQL)
- CSEE W3827: Fundamentals of Computer Systems (digital logic design and MIPS, learning components of a pipelined microprocessor)
- COMS W3261: Computer Science Theory (languages, Turing machines, complexity theory)
- COMS W4170: User Interface Design (the design process and JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JQuery)

In progress, Spring 2025:
